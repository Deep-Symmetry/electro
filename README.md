# electro

A Java library to help work with musical time. Based on the
[rhythm](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/afterglow/blob/master/src/afterglow/rhythm.clj)
namespace in
[Afterglow](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/afterglow#afterglow), ported
to plain Java to give these capabilities to [Beat
Link](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link#beat-link) without
requiring it to embed the Clojure ecosystem.

## Installation

Electro is available through Maven Central, so to use it in your Maven
project, all you need  is to include the appropriate dependency.

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/electro/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/electro)

Click the **maven central** badge above to view the repository entry
for electro. The proper format for including the latest release as a
dependency in a variety of tools can be found in the **Dependency
Information** section. If you want these kinds of capabilities from
Clojure, you are better off depending on
[Afterglow via Clojars](https://clojars.org/afterglow) and using its
Clojure-oriented `rhythm` namespace, linked at the top of the page.

If you want to manually install electro, you can download the library
from the [releases](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/electro/releases)
page and put it on your project&rsquo;s class path.

## Usage
